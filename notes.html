    <h2>Define Business?</h2>
    A business is defined as an organization or enterprising entity engaged in commercial, industrial, or
    professional
    activities. Businesses can be for-profit entities or non-profit organizations. Business types range from limited
    liability companies to sole proprietorships, corporations, and partnerships.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>What are the important features of business?</h2>
    Features are characteristics that set a product or service apart from other similar items. <br>
    The following are the ten important characteristics of a business: <br><br>
    Economic activity: Business is an economic activity of production and distribution of goods and services. <br>
    <br>
    Buying and Selling: The basic activity of any business is trading. The business involves buying of raw material,
    plants and machinery,
    stationary, property etc. On the other hand, it sells the finished products to the consumers, wholesaler,
    retailer etc. <br><br>
    Continuous process: Business is not a single time activity. It is a continuous process of production and
    distribution of goods and services. <br><br>
    Profit Motive: Profit is an indicator of success and failure of business. It is the difference between income
    and expenses of the
    business. <br><br>
    Risk and Uncertainties: Risk is defined as the effect of uncertainty arising on the objectives of the business.
    Risk is associated with every
    business. Business is exposed to two types of risk, Insurable and Non-insurable. Insurable risk is predictable.
    <br><br>
    Creative and Dynamic: Modern business is creative and dynamic in nature. Business firm has to come out with
    creative ideas, approaches and
    concepts for production and distribution of goods and services. <br><br>
    Customer satisfaction: Customer satisfaction is the ultimate aim of all economic activities. <br><br>
    Social Activity: Both business and society are interdependent. Modern business runs in the area of social
    responsibility. <br>br
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Mention the different types of business entities.</h2>
    Most business owners will choose from the six most common options: sole proprietorship, general partnership, limited
    partnership, LLC, C corporation or S corporation. <br><br>

    A sole proprietorship is the simplest business entity, with one person (or a married couple) as the sole owner and
    operator of the business. <br><br>

    General partnership share many similarities with sole proprietorships — the key difference is that the business has
    two or more owners. <br><br>

    Limited partnership Unlike a general partnership, a limited partnership, or LP, is a registered business entity. To
    form a limited
    partnership, therefore, you must file paperwork with the state. In an LP, there are two kinds of partners: those who
    own, operate and assume liability for the business (general partners), and those who act only as investors (limited
    partners, sometimes called “silent partners”) <br><br>

    A C corporation is an independent legal entity that exists separately from the company’s owners. Shareholders (the
    owners), a board of directors, and officers have control over the corporation, although one person in a C corp can
    fulfill all of these roles, so it is possible to create a corporation where you're in charge of everything.

    With this type of business entity, there are many more regulations and tax laws that the company must comply with.
    <br><br>
    An S corporation preserves the limited liability that comes with a C corporation but is a pass-through entity for
    tax
    purposes. This means that, similar to a sole prop or partnership, an S corp’s profits and losses pass through to the
    owners’ personal tax returns. There’s no corporate-level taxation for an S corp. <br>
    </p>


    <p>
    <h2>Name the elements of business environment</h2>
    <p>Political: What is the political state of the area in which the business is operating?<br>
        Economic: What are the economic factors at play in the market in which the business is operating?<br>
        Social: What are the socio-cultural factors to be taken into consideration in the environment in which the
        business is
        operating?<br>
        Technological: What technological trends are likely to be dominant in the business’s environment for the
        foreseeable
        future?<br>
        Legal: What is the legal environment like? Is there any legislation the business should take into account?
        Environmental: Does the area have any particular environmental concerns the business should consider?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Discuss the types of industries with examples</h2>
    <p>Industry is a group of productive enterprises or organizations that produce or supply goods, services, or sources
        of income.
        In
        economics, industries are customarily classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary;</p>

    <p>
        Primary industry
        This sector of a nation’s economy includes agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying, and the extraction
        of
        minerals. It may be divided into two categories: genetic industry, including the production of raw materials
        that may be
        increased by human intervention in the production process; and extractive industry, including the production of
        exhaustible raw materials that cannot be augmented through cultivation.

        example of primary industry <br>
        agriculture, oil and gas extraction, logging and forestry, mining, fishing, and trapping
    </p>

    <p>
        Secondary industry
        This sector, also called manufacturing industry, (1) takes the raw materials supplied by primary industries and
        processes them into consumer goods, or (2) further processes goods that other secondary industries have
        transformed into
        products, or (3) builds capital goods used to manufacture consumer and nonconsumer goods. Secondary industry
        also
        includes energy-producing industries.
        <br>
        Examples of secondary industries include heavy manufacturing , light manufacturing , food processing, oil
        refining and
        energy production.

    </p>

    <p>
        Tertiary industry
        This sector, also called service industry, includes industries that, while producing no tangible goods, provide
        services
        or intangible gains or generate wealth. In free market and mixed economies this sector generally has a mix of
        private
        and government enterprise.
        <br>
        The tertiary sector covers a wide range of activities from commerce to administration, transport, financial and
        real
        estate activities, business and personal services, education, health and social work.

    <h2>Discuss Maslow's hierarchy of needs</h2>
    <p>Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory of motivation which states that five categories of human needs dictate an
        individual's behavior. Those needs are physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging needs, esteem
        needs, and
        self-actualization needs.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://assets.theschooloflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/27022808/maslow-5.jpg"
            alt="image note loaded">
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Physiological needs: The first of the id-driven lower needs on Maslow's hierarchy are physiological needs.
        These most
        basic human survival needs include food and water, sufficient rest, clothing and shelter, overall health, and
        reproduction. Maslow states that these basic physiological needs must be addressed before humans move on to the
        next
        level of fulfillment.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. Safety needs: Next among the lower-level needs is safety. Safety needs include protection from violence and
        theft,
        emotional stability and well-being, health security, and financial security.
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Love and belonging needs: The social needs on the third level of Maslow’s hierarchy relate to human
        interaction and
        are the last of the so-called lower needs. Among these needs are friendships and family bonds—both with
        biological
        family (parents, siblings, children) and chosen family (spouses and partners). Physical and emotional intimacy
        ranging
        from sexual relationships to intimate emotional bonds are important to achieving a feeling of elevated kinship.
        Additionally, membership in social groups contributes to meeting this need, from belonging to a team of
        coworkers to
        forging an identity in a union, club, or group of hobbyists.
    </p>

    <p>
        4. Esteem needs: The higher needs, beginning with esteem, are ego-driven needs. The primary elements of esteem
        are
        self-respect (the belief that you are valuable and deserving of dignity) and self-esteem (confidence in your
        potential
        for personal growth and accomplishments). Maslow specifically notes that self-esteem can be broken into two
        types:
        esteem which is based on respect and acknowledgment from others, and esteem which is based on your own
        self-assessment.
        Self-confidence and independence stem from this latter type of self-esteem.
    </p>

    <p>
        5. Self-actualization needs: Self-actualization describes the fulfillment of your full potential as a person.
        Sometimes
        called self-fulfillment needs, self-actualization needs occupy the highest spot on Maslow's pyramid.
        Self-actualization
        needs include education, skill development—the refining of talents in areas such as music, athletics, design,
        cooking,
        and gardening—caring for others, and broader goals like learning a new language, traveling to new places, and
        winning
        awards.
    </p>

    <h2>What is accounting? Make a discussion on the elements of financial statements.</h2>

    <p>Accounting is the recording of financial transactions along with storing, sorting, retrieving, summarizing, and
        presenting the results in various reports</p>
    <p>
        The elements of the financial statements will be assets, liabilities, net assets/equity, revenues and expenses.
        It is
        noted in Study 1 that moving along the spectrum from cash to accrual accounting does not mean a loss of the cash
        based
        information which can still be generated from an accrual accounting system.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Who are the users of accounting information? Discuss.</h2>
    <p>
        The public, the government and its agencies, management, employees, lenders, suppliers, and other creditors in
        the
        business world are among the users of accounting information.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>
        What do you mean by Extractive Industry?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Extractive industry can be defined as a processes that involve different activities that lead to the extraction
        of raw
        materials from the earth (such as oil, metals, mineral and aggregates), processing and utilization by consumers.

    <h2>
        State the basic features of Joint Stock Company.
    </h2>
    <p>
        joint-stock company is a company whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Features of a Joint Stock Company – 8 Features: Artificial Person, Separate Legal Entity, Formation, Perpetual
        Succession, Control, Liability, Common Seal and Risk Bearing
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) Artificial Person:

        Like natural persons, a company can own property, incur debts, borrow money, enter into contracts, sue and be
        sued but
        unlike them it cannot breathe, eat, run, talk and so on. It is, therefore, called an artificial person.
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) Separate Legal Entity:

        On incorporation, a company acquires a separate legal existence in the eyes of law. The assets and liabilities
        of the
        company are separate from those of its owners.
    </p>
    <p>
        The formation of a company is a time consuming, expensive and complicated process. It involves the preparation
        of
        several documents and compliance with several legal requirements before it can start functioning. Registration
        of a
        company is compulsory as provided under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) Perpetual Succession:

        Being distinct from the members, the death, insolvency, or retirement of its members does not affect the life of
        the
        company. Member may come and go, but the company goes on forever. It will only cease to exist only when specific
        procedure of winding up is followed.
    </p>
    <p>
        (v) Control:

        The management and control of the affairs of the company is undertaken by the Board of Directors, which appoints
        the top
        management officials for running the business. The shareholders do not have the right to be involved in the
        day-to-day
        running of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
        (vi) Liability:

        The liability of the members is limited to the extent of the capital contributed by them in a company.
    </p>
    <p>
        (vii) Common Seal:

        The common seal is the engraved equivalent of an official signature. The Board of Directors enters into an
        agreement
        with others by indicating the company’s approval through a common seal. Company is bound by only those documents
        which
        bear its signature.
    </p>
    <p>
        (viii) Risk Bearing:

        The risk of losses in a company is borne by all the shareholders to the extent of their shares in the company’s
        capital.
        The risk of loss thus gets spread over a large number of shareholders.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Define Management</h2>
    <p>
        The management definition is a single or group of individuals who challenges and oversees a person or collective
        group
        of people in efforts to accomplish desired goals and objectives. Furthermore, the definition of management
        includes the
        ability to plan, organize, monitor and direct individuals.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Discuss in brief the functions of management</h2>
    <p>There are four generally accepted functions of management: planning, organizing, leading and controlling. These
        functions work together in the creation, execution and realization of organizational goals.</p>

    <p>
        1. Planning
        In the planning stage, managers establish organizational goals and create a course of action to achieve them.
        During the
        planning phase, management makes strategic decisions to set a direction for the organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Organizing
        The purpose of organizing is to distribute the resources and delegate tasks to personnel to achieve the goals
        established in the planning stage. Managers may need to work with other departments of the organization, such as
        finance
        and human resources, to organize the budget and staffing. During the organizing stage, managers strive to create
        a work
        environment conducive to productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Leading
        Leading consists of motivating employees and influencing their behavior to achieve organizational objectives.
        Leading
        focuses on managing people, such as individual employees, teams and groups rather than tasks. Though managers
        may direct
        team members by giving orders and directing to their team, managers who are successful leaders usually connect
        with
        their employees by using interpersonal skills to encourage, inspire and motivate team members to perform to the
        best of
        their abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Controlling
        Controlling is the process of evaluating the execution of the plan and making adjustments to ensure that the
        organizational goal is achieved. During the controlling stage, managers perform tasks such as training employees
        as
        necessary and managing deadlines. Managers monitor employees and evaluate the quality of their work.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Discuss the role of a manager in an organization that suggested by Henry Mintzberg.</h2>
    <p>The ten roles as per Mintzberg (1973) are: “figurehead, leader, liaison, monitor, disseminator, spokesperson,
        entrepreneur, disturbance handler, resource allocator, and negotiator”. These different roles were also divided
        into
        three main categories: “interpersonal, informational, and decisional”.</p>

    <h2>What is trail balance</h2>
    <p>
        A Trial Balance is a statement that keeps a record of the final ledger balance of all accounts in a business. It
        has two
        columns – debit and credit. Trial Balance is prepared at the end of a year and is used to prepare financial
        statements
        like Profit and Loss Account or Balance Sheet.

    <h2>
        What is break-even point?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The break-even point is the level of production at which the costs of production equal the revenues for a
        product. In
        investing, the break-even point is said to be achieved when the market price of an asset is the same as its
        original
        cost.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>What is partnership?</h2>
    <p>
        A partnership business, by definition, consists of two or more people who combine their resources to form a
        business and
        agree to share risks, profits and losses. Common partnership business examples include law firms, physician
        groups, real
        estate investment firms and accounting groups.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>What are the main features of a partnership business?</h2>
    <p>
        Following are the few features of a partnership: <br>

        Agreement between Partners: It is an association of two or more individuals, and a partnership arises from an
        agreement
        or a contract. The agreement (accord) becomes the basis of the association between the partners. Such an
        agreement is in
        the written form. An oral agreement is evenhandedly legitimate. In order to avoid controversies, it is always
        good, if
        the partners have a copy of the written agreement. <br>
        2. Two or More Persons: In order to manifest a partnership, there should be at least two (2) persons possessing
        a common
        goal. To put it in other words, the minimal number of partners in an enterprise can be two (2). However, there
        is a
        constraint on their maximum number of people. <br>
        3. Sharing of Profit: Another significant component of the partnership is, the deal between partners has to
        share
        gains and losses of a trading concern. However, the definition held in the Partnership Act elucidates –
        partnership as
        an association between people who have consented to share the gains of a business, the sharing of loss is
        implicit.
        Hence, sharing of gains and losses is vital. <br>
        4.Business Motive: It is important for a firm to carry some kind of business and should have a profit gaining
        motive. <br>
        5. Mutual Business: The partners are the owners as well as the agent of their firm. Any act performed by one
        partner can
        affect other partners and the firm. It can be concluded that this point acts as a test of partnership for all
        the
        partners. <br>
        6. Unlimited Liability: Every partner in a partnership has unlimited liability. <br>
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>
        Distinguish between a company and a Partnership firm.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Partnership Firm is a mutual agreement between two or more persons to run the business and share profit and loss
        mutually. Company is an association of persons with a common objective of providing goods and services to
        customers.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>What is meant by company form of organization?</h2>
    <p>
        A company is a legal entity formed by a group of individuals to engage in and operate a business—commercial or
        industrial—enterprise. A company may be organized in various ways for tax and financial liability purposes
        depending on
        the corporate law of its jurisdiction.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Discuss the features of a company form of organization.</h2>
    <p>
        The most important characteristics of a company: <br>
        1. Legal person – It is created by law. It is considered as a person in the eyes of law. <br>

        2. Artificial person – It has no body and mind of its own. It can act only through other persons elected for the
        purpose. <br>

        3. Continued existence – A company has a life of its own distinct from the life of its members. So the death of
        a member
        will not affect the life of the company. <br>

        4. Limited liability – The liability of the members are limited to the extent of the face value of the shares
        held by

    <h2>Distinguish between public and private companies.</h2>
    <p>
        In most cases, a private company is owned by the company's founders, management, or a group of private
        investors. A
        public company is a company that has sold all or a portion of itself to the public via an initial public
        offering.
        <br>
        One of the biggest differences between the two types of companies is how they deal with public disclosure.

        One of the biggest differences between the two types of companies is how they deal with public disclosure. If
        it's a
        public U.S. company, which means it is trading on a U.S. stock exchange, it is typically required to file
        quarterly
        earnings reports (among other things) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This information is
        made
        available to shareholders and the public. Private companies, however, are not required to disclose their
        financial
        information to anyone, since they do not trade stock on a stock exchange.

    <h2>Define Motivation. Why is it essential in an organization?</h2>
    <p>
        Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Employee motivation is key to an organisation's success. It's the level of commitment, drive and energy that a
        company's
        workers bring to the role everyday. Without it, companies experience reduced productivity, lower levels of
        output and
        it's likely that the company will fall short of reaching important goals too

    <h2> Critically evaluate Maslow's need hierarchy theory. </h2>
    <p>
        the most significant criticism of Maslow's hierarchy of needs concerns the unscientific approach, use of
        unreliable
        samples and the specific research methods he used to draw conclusions to the study. The study was not based on
        any
        credible empirical research.

    <h2>What is meant by accounting equation?</h2>
    <p>
        The accounting equation states that a company's total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and its
        shareholders' equity. This straightforward relationship between assets, liabilities, and equity is considered to
        be the
        foundation of the double-entry accounting system.

    <h3>What is equity?</h3>
    <p>
        Equity represents the value that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all of the assets were
        liquidated and
        all of the company's debts were paid off.

    <h2>What is T account?</h2>
    <p>A T-account is an informal term for a set of financial records that use double-entry bookkeeping. It is called a
        T-account because the bookkeeping entries are laid out in a way that resembles a T-shape. The account title
        appears just
        above the T.</p>

    <p>
    <h2>
        What do you mean by accounting cycle

        within a
        business during a particular accounting period.

    <h2>Define break-even chart</h2>
    <p>
        A breakeven chart is a chart that shows the sales volume level at which total costs equal sales. Losses will be
        incurred
        below this point, and profits will be earned above this point.
